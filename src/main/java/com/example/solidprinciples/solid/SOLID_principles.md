## SOLID Principle

### Single Responsibility
A class or component should have only one responsibility or purpose. Therefor, only one reason to change.

### Open Close
A class or component should be open for extension and closed for modification.
So, whenever a new functionality we should create new class or function for that functionality.

### Liskov Substitution
Subtypes should be completely substitutable for their Base or Parent types.

### Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes implement what they can't do

### Dependency Inversion
A class or component should not depend on concrete implementation rather it should depend on abstraction.
